    <h2>position: static;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the
        normal flow of the page:</p>

    <div class="static">
        This div element has position: static;
    </div>
    <h2>position: relative;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>

    <div class="relative">
        This div element has position: relative;
    </div>
    <h2>position: fixed;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same
        place even if the page is scrolled:</p>

    <div class="fixed">
        This div element has position: fixed;
    </div>
    <h2>position: absolute;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
        positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

    <div class="relative02">This div element has position: relative;
        <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
    </div>

    <h1>Z-index Example</h1>

    <p>An element with greater stack order is always above an element with a lower stack order.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="black-box">Black box (z-index: 1)</div>
        <div class="gray-box">Gray box (z-index: 3)</div>
        <div class="green-box">Green box (z-index: 2)</div>
    </div>
